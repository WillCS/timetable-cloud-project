# Timetable Optimiser Cloud Application
An unfinished project that helped me learn about functional programming. (THIS CODE IS BAD)

## Components
* Front-end `/webapp/`
* Api       `/api/`
* Spark Processing `/optimiser/`

## Rebirth
The frontend I built for this project lives on in my [timetable_planner_sequel](https://github.com/WillCS/timetable-planner-sequel) repo. It's actually functional and I feel like it's worth preserving.
